# Image-Encryption-and-Decryption-using-java
<b><br>
The Image Encryption and Decryption Project in Java is a software application that aims to provide an efficient and secure way to encrypt and decrypt images. The project involves the development of a Java application that uses symmetric key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt images. The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly software tool that can be used to protect sensitive images from unauthorized access.

1)Initially we can see that image (planet_1.png) is not encrypted and we can see that image is visible and can be accessed by the user.

<br><br><br>
2)After compilation of encryption program, the image is secured after setting up the key and  encryption is done.

<br><br><br>
4)After compilation of the decryption program, we have to enter the key to decrypt the image to make it accessible by the user.

<br><br><br>
5)Now after decryption of the program, it is now accessible and is visible in the system.
